#summary Emulation Event Log format quick reference page

= EEL =

EEL is the Emulation Event Log, a text file format for scripting emulation events or logging them. A more verbose description can be found on the [http://pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/mnmtools/ mnmtools] (Mobile Network Modeling Tools) page.


= EEL location events =
A location event determines the absolute position of a node at the given time. This is in contrast to a waypoint destination and velocity vector. When used with EMANE's Universal PHY, you would set the _pathloss mode_ to _*freespace*_ or _*2ray*_.

== GPS coordinates ==

The fields for GPS location events are: _time, NEM ID, "location", "gps", latitude, longitude, altitude_

0.0 nem:4 location gps 40.031290,-74.523095,3.000000

= EEL pathloss events =
A pathloss event specifies the pathloss in decibels (dB).
When used with EMANE's Universal PHY, you would set the _pathloss mode_ to _*pathloss*_. When pathloss mode is used, the location of a node no longer determines connectivity.

A packet received in EMANE has the following received power calculation, that determines whether or not the packet will be dropped:
_Rx Power (dBm) = Tx Power (dBm) + Tx Antenna Gain (dBi) + Rx Antenna Gain (dBi) - *Pathloss (dB)*_

The fields for pathloss events are: _time, source NEM ID, "pathloss", destination NEM ID,pathloss-value_.

Multiple destination NEM IDs may be specified. The example below shows three NEMs, with each line specifying two destination NEMs. Note that loss can be asymmetrical.
