#summary Emulation Event Log format quick reference page

= EEL =

EEL is the Emulation Event Log, a text file format for scripting emulation events or logging them. A more verbose description can be found on the [http://pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/mnmtools/ mnmtools] (Mobile Network Modeling Tools) page.


= EEL location events =
A location event determines the absolute position of a node at the given time. This is in contrast to a waypoint destination and velocity vector. When used with EMANE's Universal PHY, you would set the _pathloss mode_ to _*freespace*_ or _*2ray*_.

== GPS coordinates ==

The fields for GPS location events are: _time, NEM ID, "location", "gps", latitude, longitude, altitude_

== Cartesian coordinates ==

= EEL pathloss events =
A pathloss event specifies the pathloss in decibels.
When used with EMANE's Universal PHY, you would set the _pathloss mode_ to _*pathloss*_.
