#summary CORE and the EMANE emulator

= General Info =

EMANE is a mobile ad-hoc network emulation system that can be used in conjunction with CORE to provide more complex wireless radio models.

= Easy EMANE Install =

Here are easy EMANE instructions for Fedora 12 i386. Replace with "x86_64" if needed. Run these as root.

{{{
# install dependencies
yum -y install openssl-devel perl-XML-Simple perl-XML-LibXML
# download and install EMANE 0.6.3
wget http://labs.cengen.com/emane/download/RPMS/F12/0.6.3/i386/emane-bundle-0.6.3.fc12.i386.tgz
mkdir emane-0.6.3
cd emane-0.6.3
tar xzf ../emane-bundle-0.6.3.fc12.i386.tgz
# ACE libs must be installed first
rpm -ivh ace*
rm -f ace*
rpm -ivh *
}}} 


Here are instructions for Ubuntu 10.10.

{{{
# install dependencies
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libxml-libxml-perl libxml-simple-perl
# download and install EMANE 0.6.4
wget http://labs.cengen.com/emane/download/deb/ubuntu-10_04/0.6.4/amd64/emane-bundle-0.6.4.amd64.tgz
mkdir emane-0.6.4
cd emane-0.6.4
tar xzf ../emane-bundle-0.6.4.amd64.tgz
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
}}}

= Easy EMANE Uninstall =

Remove everything with one command:

{{{
rpm -e `rpm -qa | grep -i emane | xargs`
}}}

Don't forget about the ACE libraries.

{{{
rpm -e ace-devel ace-gperf ace
}}}

= Misc Info =

Setting the delay in the RF-PIPE MAC adds a transmission delay, not a propagation delay (as one might consider CORE link delays.) The tx delay is affected by the packet size and transmit rate:

 * *delay*: Defines the delay (usec) that is to be included in the transmission delay. The delay is added to the delay introduced by the bitrate defined above. (from http://labs.cengen.com/emane/doc/0.7.1/html/rfpipe.0.7.1.html)


*Event generator*: produces events and is launched by the Event Service XML.<br>
*Event Daemon* / *Event Agent*: transport event data from emulation to other app domains; e.g. gpsdlocationagent
