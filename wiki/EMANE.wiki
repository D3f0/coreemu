#summary CORE and the EMANE emulator

= General Info =

EMANE is a mobile ad-hoc network emulation system that can be used in conjunction with CORE to provide more complex wireless radio models.

= Easy EMANE Install =

Here are easy EMANE instructions for Fedora 12 i386. Replace with "x86_64" if needed. Run these as root.

{{{
# install dependencies
yum -y install openssl-devel perl-XML-Simple perl-XML-LibXML
# download and install EMANE 0.6.3
wget http://labs.cengen.com/emane/download/RPMS/F12/0.6.3/i386/emane-bundle-0.6.3.fc12.i386.tgz
mkdir emane-0.6.3
cd emane-0.6.3
tar xzf ../emane-bundle-0.6.3.fc12.i386.tgz
# ACE libs must be installed first
rpm -ivh ace*
rm -f ace*
rpm -ivh *
}}} 

Here are instructions for Ubuntu 11.10. Note that Ubuntu 11.10 has libace-dev (6.0.1-3) and libace-6.0.1 (6.0.1-3) libraries, but here we will install ACE (6.0.8-1) included with the EMANE bundle.

{{{
# install dependencies
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libxml-libxml-perl libxml-simple-perl
# download and install EMANE 0.7.3
wget http://labs.cengen.com/emane/download/deb/ubuntu-11_10/0.7.3/amd64/emane-bundle-0.7.3.amd64.tgz
mkdir emane-bundle-0.7.3
cd emane-bundle-0.7.3
tar xzf ../emane-bundle-0.7.3.amd64.tgz
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
}}}

= Easy EMANE Uninstall =

Remove everything with one command:

{{{
rpm -e `rpm -qa | grep -i emane | xargs`
}}}

Don't forget about the ACE libraries.

{{{
rpm -e ace-devel ace-gperf ace
}}}

For Ubuntu, open the Synaptic package manager and choose the "Installed (local or obsolete)" section. Select the various EMANE packages using shift+click, right-click and choose remove.

= Misc Info =

Setting the delay in the RF-PIPE MAC adds a transmission delay, not a propagation delay (as one might consider CORE link delays.) The tx delay is affected by the packet size and transmit rate:

 * *delay*: Defines the delay (usec) that is to be included in the transmission delay. The delay is added to the delay introduced by the bitrate defined above. (from http://labs.cengen.com/emane/doc/0.7.1/html/rfpipe.0.7.1.html)


*Event generator*: produces events and is launched by the Event Service XML.<br>
*Event Daemon* / *Event Agent*: transport event data from emulation to other app domains; e.g. gpsdlocationagent


= Old Notes =

Here are Ubuntu 11.10 build notes for EMANE 0.7.2. EMANE 0.7.3 now has 11.10 debs, so these instructions are obsolete.

Instructions for building a deb from source on Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric. (As of this writing, pre-built debs were not available.) Note that the deb build dependencies (e.g. dh-make, etc) are slightly different than the run-time dependencies.

{{{
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libxml-libxml-perl libxml-simple-perl
sudo apt-get install libace libace-dev dh-make doxygen
tar xzf emane-0.7.1.tgz
cd emane-0.7.1
autoconf && automake
./configure --prefix=/usr
# to use Ubuntu's libace package, edit the debian/control file
# search and replace "ace" with "libace-dev"
make deb
