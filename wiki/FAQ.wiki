#summary Frequently Asked Questions

== 1. Who produced CORE? ==

The Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) is derived from the [http://www.tel.fer.hr/imunes/ Integrated Multiprotocol Network Emulator/Simulator] (IMUNES) emulator. CORE was developed primarily by [mailto:jeffrey.m.ahrenholz@boeing.com Jeff Ahrenholz] from Boeing Research & Technology. Boeing Research & Technology has contributed CORE as an open source project, and the [http://cs.itd.nrl.navy.mil/products/ Naval Research Laboratory] (NRL) has graciously agreed to host CORE source code and mailing lists as part of a broader Mobile Network Modeling effort.

See the [http://hipserver.mct.phantomworks.org/core/manual/Prior-Work.html#Prior-Work Prior Work] and [http://hipserver.mct.phantomworks.org/core/manual/Acknowledgements.html#Acknowledgements Acknowledgements] section in the CORE manual for more details.

== 2. Who maintains CORE? ==

CORE is an open source project led by [mailto:jeffrey.m.ahrenholz@boeing.com Jeff Ahrenholz].  Boeing Research & Technology is supporting CORE in 2009 through a project led by Jeff.  

== 3. How does CORE differ from IMUNES? ==

At a high level, the main differences betwen CORE and IMUNES are with GUI enhancements, kernel enhancements, support for wireless networking, Linux support, distributed emulation, and packaging.

*GUI:* OSPF-MANET integration, GUI-base on/off wireless, Remote control Linux routers, tunnel node, ktunnel node, widget framework: CPU, adjacency, throughput widgets; observer widgets: (various); mobility tool, two-node tool, run tool, marker tool, distributed wired networks, distributed wireless networks, MRU file list, preferences dialog, node renumbering, random topology generator, annotations, debugger

*Utilities:* wireless daemon framework: simple wireless model, scripted mobility model, GPS utility model; Span Tool for CORE-CORE tunnels; Span Tool for BSD/Linux/Win XP virtual interface; OpenVZ + NetEm support

*Kernel:* 
FreeBSD 4.11 IPsec virtualization, FreeBSD 7.1 multicast routing virtualization, divert socket virtualization, ng_pipe module supporting ng_wlan and new effects, ng_wlan module

*Packaging:* binary installers, user manual, API manual, flash demos

== 4. How is CORE licensed? ==

CORE is open source software, licensed under the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license 3-clause BSD license].

== 5. Are there any technical publications about CORE? ==
== 6. How many nodes can CORE emulate? ==
