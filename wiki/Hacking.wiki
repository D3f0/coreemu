#summary Coding standards and guide to CORE source code

= Introduction =

Also refer to this [http://hipserver.mct.phantomworks.org/core/manual/Developer_0027s-Guide.html Developer's Guide] section in the CORE manual.

Where possible, the coding style used in existing code should be followed. For example, CORE consists of Tcl/Tk scripts from the IMUNES project, C kernel code for FreeBSD, and C userspace code. Please refer to the appropriate style guidelines for the kernel code, for example.

Any contributions to the CORE project must adhere to these standards.

= Standards =
*licensing* - CORE is BSD licensed. Only free software having the same or compatible licensing is accepted.

*identifier naming conventions*
 * Tcl/Tk: 
   * function names are CamelCase with a lowercase first letter, example: `proc findFreeIPv6Net { mask } {`
   * variable names are lowercase words, can have underscores; global variables that are not lists or arrays have a `g_` prefix, example: `set node_types "remote"; global g_prefs`
   * constants are defined in all uppercase, with underscores separating words; defined constants should be used instead of magic numbers, example: `set DEFAULT_RANGE 275`
 * C: 
   * function names are lowercase words separated by underscores, example: `int receive_file_msg(int, uin8_t *, uint16_t);`
   * variable names are lowercase letters or words with words separated by underscores, example: `int max, err, do_flush;`
   * constants are defined in all uppercase, with underscores separating words; defined constants should be used instead of magic numbers, example: `#define MAX_NODES 32`
   * global variables are used sparingly, named in all lowercase as above, should have a `g_` prefix, example: `struct core_wlan_model *g_models`
   * macros are defined in all caps with words combined together, example: `#define MAC2STR(addr) ...\`

*indentation*
 * Tcl/Tk: proc declarations are not indented; *four-space indenting* is used, with tabs used to represent each indentation of *eight spaces*; example
{{{
proc myProc { node } {
....foreach ifc [ifcList $node] {
>-------set peer [peerByIfc $ifc]
}}}

 * C: lines start with an *eight-space tab indenting* (a tab character, not eight space characters) and each level is indented with a tab character, example:
{{{
>-------if (do_daemon) {
>------->-------/* do something */
>------->-------if (error_condition)
>------->------->-------exit(1);
}}}
