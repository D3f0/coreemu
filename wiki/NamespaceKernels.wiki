#summary List of known good/bad kernels.

This page lists known good/bad kernels for the [Namespaces] version of CORE.

Some part of the kernel not working well within namespaces? See the [CustomKernels] page also.

  * 2.6.32
  * 2.6.33
  * 2.6.35.7 (Arch Linux)
  * 2.6.40.3-0.fc15.x86_64

= Known bad kernels =
  * IPv6 snooping bug - OSPFv3 hellos jump off the bridge
    * Look at output of `netstat -s | grep invalid` to see "invalid headers"
