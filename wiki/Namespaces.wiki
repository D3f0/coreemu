#summary CORE HOWTO and references for Linux network namespaces

= Introduction =

Linux network namespaces (netns) is a lightweight container-based virtualization that is part of the mainline 2.6.27+ Linux kernel. A virtual network stack can be associated with a process group. This is similar to the FreeBSD jail mechanism.

Each namespace has its own loopback device and process space. Virtual or real devices can be added to each network namespace, and you can assign IP addresses to these devices and use them as a network node. By default these network namespaces share the same filesystem, just like CORE nodes in FreeBSD. Netns does not have the same security and resource restrictions as OpenVZ containers, and do not require a separate OS template.

You do not need to patch your kernel in order to use network namespaces. Modern distros such as Fedora 12 and Ubuntu 9.10 have netns support turned on in their default kernels.

= CORE Namespaces HOWTO =

The development snapshot of CORE supports network namespaces for virtualization and does not require OpenVZ. The next 4.0 release of CORE will feature this support. Until that release is completed you can try the development snapshot:

 # install Fedora 12 or Ubuntu 9.10 (namespace support is built-in!)
 # freshen your kernel version using {{{ yum update }}}
 # install the packages required to compile CORE:
   {{{ yum install autoconf automake bash bridge-utils ebtables gcc libev-devel libtool make pkgconfig python-devel sudo tcl tk urw-fonts xauth xorg-x11-server-utils xterm }}}
 # grab the development snapshot from [http://downloads.pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/core/source/nightly_snapshots/core-svnsnap.tgz core-svnsnap.tgz]
 # unpack and build:
{{{
   tar xzf core-svnsnap.tgz
   cd core
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./configure   ;# this command should report "Linux Namespaces emulation: yes"
   make
   sudo make install
}}}
 # after installing, start the CORE services: `sudo /etc/init.d/core start`
 # run the CORE GUI: `sudo core`

Note that all features may not be available in this network namespaces version of CORE. We are working to make the system more modular and preserve functionality across versions.
