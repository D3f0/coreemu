#summary Random tips and tricks relating to CORE, FreeBSD, and OpenVZ

Here we're collecting tips for CORE, FreeBSD, and OpenVZ. Please add your tips here.

= CORE tips =
tips for CORE that are not OS-specific


= FreeBSD tips =
tips for FreeBSD

 * 1. on FreeBSD 7.2 for the amd64 platform, running `pkg_add -r` causes the following error:
{{{
 Error: FTP Unable to get ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/amd64/packages-7-stable/Latest/*.tbz: Not Found
}}}
 a workaround is to use `sysinstall` and choose `Configure` and `Packages` and choose your appropriate FTP/HTTP option, and select and install packages there
 * 2. when you run `pkg_add core-7.x-3.4.tbz` you receive the following messages:
{{{
pkg_add: warning: package 'core-7.x-3.4' requires 'bash-3.2.25', but 'bash-4.0.10_2' is installed
pkg_add: warning: package 'core-7.x-3.4' requires 'tcl-8.4.16,1', but 'tcl-8.4.19_2,1' is installed
pkg_add: warning: package 'core-7.x-3.4' requires 'tk-8.4.16,2', but 'tk-8.4.19_2,2' is installed
}}}
 This is OK, the warnings may be safely ignored. CORE is not particular about which version of bash, Tcl, or Tk are used. An earlier version number is used in the package file so that CORE will install on older FreeBSD 7.0 systems.
 * 3. Keep your FreeBSD packages up-to-date:
{{{
pkg_add -r portupgrade
# use -ai to request confirmations
portupgrade -a
}}}

= OpenVZ tips =
tips for Linux

 # modify the standard OpenVZ config in `/etc/vz/vz.conf` (reboot to enable these changes):
  * DISK_QUOTA=no
  * IPV6="yes"
