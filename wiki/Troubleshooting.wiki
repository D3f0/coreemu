#summary Troubleshooting

== General ==
 * first check the known issues under [ReleaseNotes] for the version of CORE you are using!
 * [http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fpf.itd.nrl.navy.mil%2Fpipermail%2Fcore-users%2F&oq=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fpf.itd.nrl.navy.mil%2Fpipermail%2Fcore-users%2F search the mailing list]
 * also be sure to check out the [http://code.google.com/p/coreemu/issues/list bug tracker]

== Linux version ==
 * *log files:*
   * `/var/log/coredpy.log` - CORE Python daemon log file
   * `/tmp/pycore.nnnnn/nX.log` - each node has a log file (where `nnnnn` is session number and `X` is the node number)

 * *Issue:* per-node directories not working; all nodes see the same thing in `/var/log` for example, pointing to the last bind mount. This occurs in Fedora 15. 
 * *Resolution:* turn off sandbox using `chkconfig sandbox off` and reboot

 * *Issue:* quagga does not start successfully.  When I enter into a namespace context and type "zebra -d", the following error occurs:
{{{
zebra: error while loading shared libraries: libzebra.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
}}}
 * *Resolution:*  If you have installed quagga without running ldconfig afterwards, the path may have not been picked up.  Try running "ldconfig".  Then, run "ldconfig -p | grep libzebra" to make sure it took effect, and restart core.

== FreeBSD version == 
 * *debugging commands:*
   * `vimage -l` - lists all running vimages
   * `ngctl list` - list all Netgraph nodes
   * `ngctl show ...` - detailed information about a Netgraph node
